# Circular Array

If an array is said to be wrapped around (i.e. circular) and that you need to find the maximum or minimum value of a contiguous subarray, think of the array as two separate cases:

1. Within normal range
2. Wrap around
   1. For this case, invert that thought process and find the opposite of the contiguous wrap-around subarray. What's left in the array is the part you're not finding - so take that and subtract it from the total of the array.
